Introduction

Starting with 2.0, GSBase is licensed under an Apache style license. The full contents of this license are below.

Prior to 2.0, GSBase was licensed under the LGPL . This change in license was done to ensure that GSBase could be used by the greatest number of projects possible. There is a fair bit of general confusion about the viral nature of the LGPL so the license for GSBase has been changed to one that is generally better understood.
